This is my 2nd Big Project in C, and this one i got inpsired from our laboratory questions
one question was to make a source file called inventory, where we learn structs by
giving struct members of struct tag "inventory", int on_hand, char name[20], and int id,
i liked the program very much, at first i thought it was very stupid and boring, but then
as it expanded, i saw it as a store like program, so i decided to try and do a store 
and at first i started with a single source file, for all the variables, struct and those
stuff, in the beginning it wasn't that great, i spent around an hour and built the structs
and the messages.., it still needed alot of polishing and functionality, so i decided 
(from the beginning of course) to build functionality, and when everything works, then 
the polishing part comes, where there doesn't be case sensitive areas around.

this project also took me around 5-6 days, but i spent between 13-16 hours, it was alot
of fun seeing how the project was working and i got very happy with how the project 
became in the end.

in the future i'm thinking of continuing this store into an actual store with 
visualization, which means i have to learn front and back end development in 
web development so i can make the store project real.

hopefully when i have the time to learn html css and javascript, and python for backend
i'm going to make this store project the 1st big project of web development!
